# Android-apps from scratch 

For the Instagram clone app, set up the parse server on AWS EC2, create login and signup page, create a menu for sharing and logout, allow the current user to upload photo from the camera and display the users list and access to the shared photoes when clikcing on the item corresponing to a user. 

For the Uber clone app, the login page with a switch for rider/driver uses anonymous utilities in parse server. For the driver, he or she can view the 20 nearby requests from the riders and click on the item to accept the request from the rider. Then a goole map activity shows the location of the driver and the rider and can start the navigation from the driver to the rider. And for the rider,  he or she can request a Uber driver and the location of the driver will show out when a driver accepted the request. Also the distance from the rider and the driver displays and updates every 2 seconds. When the driver arrives, this request from the rider will be deleted in the parse server.
